# RSVP-Movies-Case-Study
RSVP Movies is an Indian flim production company which has produced many superhit movies. They have usually produced movies for Indian audience but, now they are palnning their next project for the global audience. The production company wants to plan every move analytically and approached us with the IMDb data of the movies released in past three years. This project is based on MySQL and I have used various SQL queries right from the basics to advanced SQL to derive the useful insights and help the company for their future palnning and decision making for upcoming projects.
